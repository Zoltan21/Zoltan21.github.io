        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Our project's goal is to introduce local handicraft traditions and thereby strengthen community cohesion. 
        We aim to create an inclusive environment where anyone can participate and learn. 
        The program helps participants acquire new skills, which can assist in career choices. 
        In addition to preserving traditions, we consider active participation important, so it’s not only about individual development, 
        but also about strengthening our community. We emphasize:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> the effective promotion of traditional crafts among younger audiences</li>
          <li> cultural education and the organization of events</li>
          <li> the development of artistic and design skills</li>
          <li> the learning of traditional craft techniques</li>
          <li> the use of modern communication tools in the service of tradition preservation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>July – Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Forestry</h2>
        <p>In July, we held our workshop on sustainable and eco-friendly forestry. The rich forest along the Máréfalva stream provided an ideal location.
      
        We would like to express our gratitude to Uncle Laci, who contributed to the day’s success with his expertise and experience.
      
        We gained a wealth of exciting and useful information – for example, we learned that during forest planting, we should primarily think of our grandchildren, as the trees we plant today will bring value to their generation.
        We also learned that pest control is crucial: without proper protection, decades of work can be lost in just a few weeks.</p>

        <h2>June – Enamel Art Workshop at the Cultural House in Székelyudvarhely</h2>
        <p>In June, we held our enamel workshop, where everyone could unleash their creativity.
        We worked with small copper plates, which we first coated and then fired in a kiln. Next came the decoration phase: everyone painted their favorite motifs on the plates, which were then fired again.
        The process was not only exciting but also visually stunning – for instance, the bright orange enamel turned into a deep, elegant red after firing, which surprised us all.
        The shared creative experience was truly memorable and something we will surely talk about for a long time!</p>

        <h2>May – Székely Gate Carving</h2>
        <p>In May, we organized our gate carving workshop, where we explored various traditional techniques.
        During the session, we learned that the most widespread method in the area is the so-called "driving chisel" technique. The design is first drawn on the wood, then carved precisely along the lines using a driving chisel and hammer.
        The next step is to use the clearing chisel to remove excess wood around the pattern, thus highlighting the motifs.
        Interestingly, we found out that the driving chisel is usually made of iron and requires a hammer, while the clearing chisel is mostly wooden, suitable for finer work and used with a mallet – a smaller wooden hammer.</p>

        <h2>April – Project Presentation</h2>
        <p>In April, we presented our project to local youth, who received the initiative with openness and enthusiasm.
        During the meeting, we received many valuable ideas and suggestions from them on how to make the project more well-known and appealing to the broader community.
        It was inspiring to see how creatively and actively they engaged with the topic.</p>

        <p>In March, we prepared both the online and offline platforms through which we plan to showcase and promote our project in the future.
        We also designed the project's unique logo, aiming to harmoniously combine traditional motifs with modern visual elements – expressing the connection between past and present.</p>

        <p>In February, Tardos participated in a training session in Bucharest aimed at preparing for ESC projects.
        During the program, we gained many useful and valuable insights into project management. The training helped us better understand how to plan, organize, and effectively implement our own ESC project.</p>
